        Tailor the extracurricular activities section by selecting only relevant activities that add value to the job application.

        Current Extracurricular Activities:
        {current_extracurricular}

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}
        - Industry: {job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}
        - Company Culture: {job_requirements.get('company_culture', '')}
        - Soft Skills: {job_requirements.get('soft_skills', [])}
        - Essential Requirements: {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}

        Instructions:
        1. Select ONLY extracurricular activities that demonstrate relevant skills or qualities
        2. Order them by relevance to the target role
        3. Remove activities that are:
           - Completely unrelated to professional skills
           - Too personal or not professionally relevant
           - Outdated or from too long ago
        4. Keep activities that demonstrate:
           - Leadership skills
           - Teamwork and collaboration
           - Skills mentioned in job requirements
           - Qualities that align with company culture
           - Community involvement (if valued by company)

        Be very selective - most extracurricular activities should be removed for professional roles.

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "relevant_activities": list of relevant extracurricular activities in order of relevance (empty list if none are relevant)
        - "removed_activities": list of activity names that were removed
        - "changes_summary": brief explanation of selection criteria and changes made
