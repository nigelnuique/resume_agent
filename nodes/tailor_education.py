        You are tailoring education section highlights ONLY. DO NOT change institutions, degrees, dates, or any other details.

        Current Education Highlights to Modify:
        {education_highlights}

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}
        - Industry: {job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}
        - Key Technologies: {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])}
        - Essential Requirements: {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}

        CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. ONLY modify the highlights content - nothing else
        2. DO NOT change or invent institution names, degrees, areas, or dates
        3. For each education entry, provide improved highlights that:
           - Format relevant coursework as ONE line: "Relevant coursework: Course 1, Course 2, Course 3, Course 4, Course 5"
           - Select ONLY the 5 most relevant courses that align with job requirements
           - Include other achievements (GPA, scholarships, etc.) as separate highlights
           - Focus on skills and knowledge gained that apply to the target role
        4. Keep highlights factual and realistic
        5. IMPORTANT: Coursework should be formatted as a single comma-separated line, not individual bullet points

        FORMATTING EXAMPLE:
        Instead of:
        - "Course 1"
        - "Course 2" 
        - "Course 3"
        
        Use:
        - "Relevant coursework: Course 1, Course 2, Course 3"
        - "Other achievement (e.g., GPA, scholarship)"

        Return a JSON object with:
