        Instructions:
        1. Keep all institutions, degrees, dates, and locations exactly as they are
        2. For each education entry, optimize the highlights:
           - If there's a "Relevant Coursework:" highlight, consolidate it into ONE line with 0-5 most relevant courses
           - Select courses that align with job requirements and key technologies
           - Keep other achievements (GPA, scholarships, thesis, capstone) as separate highlights
           - Order highlights by importance (achievements first, then coursework)
        3. Format coursework as: "Relevant coursework: Course 1, Course 2, Course 3, Course 4"
        4. If no courses are relevant to the target role, omit the coursework highlight entirely

        CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES:
        - Keep coursework as a highlight bullet point, NOT as a separate field
        - NEVER truncate existing descriptions with "..." - preserve full text of capstone projects, thesis descriptions, etc.
        - If a capstone or thesis description exists, keep the COMPLETE original text
        - Only modify coursework lists, not project/thesis descriptions

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "education_entries": list of optimized education entries with updated highlights
        - "changes_summary": brief explanation of changes made
