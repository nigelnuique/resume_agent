        Standard section priority guidelines:
        1. professional_summary - Always first
        2. For experienced roles: experience before education
        3. For technical roles: skills before projects if heavily technical
        4. For research roles: education and projects higher priority
        5. projects - Higher if role emphasizes specific project experience
