        Based on this job advertisement analysis and current CV sections, determine which sections to KEEP and their optimal order.

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}
        - Industry: {job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}
        - Experience Level: {job_requirements.get('experience_level', 'Not specified')}
        - Key Technologies: {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])}
        - Essential Requirements: {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}

        Current CV Sections:
        {current_sections}

        Guidelines for section inclusion and ordering:
        1. professional_summary - Always keep and place first
        2. skills/experience - Essential for most roles, order based on role type
        3. projects - Keep if role emphasizes project work or technical skills
        4. education - Keep for entry-level or academic roles, may remove for senior roles if not relevant
        5. certifications - Keep only if relevant to role requirements
        6. extracurricular - Often not relevant for professional roles, remove unless specifically valuable
        7. publications - Keep only for research/academic roles
        8. languages - Keep only if mentioned in job requirements or international role

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "sections_to_keep": ordered list of section names to include in final CV
        - "sections_to_remove": list of section names to remove completely
        - "reasoning": brief explanation for inclusions and exclusions

        Be selective - a focused CV is better than a comprehensive one.
