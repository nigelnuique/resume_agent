        Based on this job advertisement analysis, determine the optimal order for existing CV sections.
        IMPORTANT: Only suggest removing sections that are truly irrelevant - most sections have already been processed by specialized functions.

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}
        - Industry: {job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}
        - Experience Level: {job_requirements.get('experience_level', 'Not specified')}
        - Key Technologies: {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])}
        - Essential Requirements: {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}

        Available CV Sections (with content):
        {list(sections_with_content.keys())}

        Empty sections (will be removed): {empty_sections}

        Guidelines for section ordering:
        1. professional_summary - Always first
        2. skills/experience - Order based on role emphasis (technical vs managerial)
        3. projects - High priority for technical roles
        4. education/certifications - Lower priority for experienced roles
        5. extracurricular - Lowest priority, remove only if truly irrelevant

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "optimal_order": ordered list of section names for final CV
        - "sections_to_remove": list of section names to remove (be conservative - only truly irrelevant ones)
        - "reasoning": brief explanation for the ordering and any removals

        Be conservative with removals - sections have already been tailored by specialized functions.
