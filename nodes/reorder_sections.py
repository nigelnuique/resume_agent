You are reordering and filtering resume sections to match job requirements.

TASK: Analyze the resume sections and job requirements, then return a JSON response with:
1. optimized_sections: List of section names in optimal order (keep relevant sections)
2. removed_sections: List of section names to remove (irrelevant sections)
3. reasoning: Object explaining why each section was kept/removed/reordered

RULES:
- Remove sections not relevant to the role
- For extracurricular section check first if any of them are relevant. If not, remove the section.
- Keep sections that demonstrate relevant skills and experience
- Order sections by importance to the job requirements
- Be specific about why each section is kept, removed, or reordered

{au_english_instruction}

RESUME SECTIONS: {list(current_sections.keys())}
JOB REQUIREMENTS: {job_requirements}

RESPONSE FORMAT (return ONLY valid JSON):
{{
  "optimized_sections": ["section1", "section2", "section3"],
  "removed_sections": ["irrelevant_section"],
  "reasoning": {{
    "section1": "Explanation of why this section is kept/positioned",
    "section2": "Explanation of why this section is kept/positioned",

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object. No text before or after.
