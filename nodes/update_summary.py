You are updating the *Professional Summary* section of a MASTER r√©sum√©
to create a *Targeted R√©sum√©* for ONE specific job.{au_english_instruction}

### Context
‚Ä¢ The master CV covers the candidate's actual background and experience
‚Ä¢ The target role is described below ‚Äì highlight what matters and
  downplay what doesn't.

### Inputs
CURRENT_SUMMARY = {current_summary}
JOB_REQUIREMENTS = {{
  "role_focus": {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])},
  "industry_domain": "{job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}",
  "key_technologies": {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])},
  "essential_requirements": {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])},
  "certifications_required": {job_requirements.get('certifications_required', [])},
  "technical_expertise": {job_requirements.get('technical_expertise', [])},
  "professional_qualifications": {job_requirements.get('professional_qualifications', [])}
}}

### CANDIDATE'S ACTUAL SKILLS (ONLY MENTION THESE):
{state['working_cv']['cv']['sections'].get('skills', [])}

### What to do
1. **Analyze the candidate's actual background**
   - Review their real professional experience and education
   - Identify their genuine strengths and relevant skills
   - Understand their career progression and transitions

2. **Match to job requirements**
   - Highlight experience that directly relates to the role
   - Emphasize transferable skills that apply to the position
   - Connect their background to the job's needs
   - Pay special attention to technical expertise and professional qualifications mentioned in job requirements

3. **Be honest about experience level**
   - If main professional experience is in different field, be honest about this
   - Distinguish between professional experience and academic/project experience
   - Don't inflate experience in areas where they have limited professional background
   - Example: If someone has 3 years in one field + MS in another field, say "Professional transitioning to [new field]" NOT "3+ years in [new field]"

4. **Structure the summary with varied openings**
   - 50-60 words, 2-3 sentences
<<<<<<< HEAD
   - Use natural, varied sentence starters (avoid "Technical professional" or similar generic phrases)
   - Examples of good openings:
     * "Data scientist with experience in..."
     * "Experienced in Python programming and..."
     * "Skilled at building predictive models..."
     * "Passionate about leveraging data to..."
     * "Background in [specific field] with expertise in..."
   - Lead with most relevant experience or skills
   - Include key skills that match job requirements
   - End with enthusiasm for the role
   - If mentioning education, always highlight the most recent and highest degree (e.g., MS over BS).

### CRITICAL RULES:
- Base everything on the candidate's ACTUAL experience in the master CV
- Do NOT invent experience they don't have or inflate experience they do have
- Be honest about their background and transitions
- Focus on transferable skills and genuine qualifications
- Match the tone to the job requirements and company culture
<<<<<<< HEAD
- AVOID generic phrases like "Technical professional", "Experienced professional", "Skilled professional"
- Use specific, varied language that reflects the candidate's actual background
- NEVER use vague headers like "Technical Professional." Use the exact role title from the job ad, or‚Äîif that title doesn't match the candidate's background‚Äîsubstitute "[industry] professional," e.g., "Data Professional."
- If the job emphasizes "technical and professional expertise," highlight the candidate's actual technical skills and professional qualifications
- Emphasize relevant certifications, technical skills, and professional credentials that align with the role
- ALTERNATIVES to "Technical Professional": Use specific terms like "Data Science Professional," "Cloud Technology Professional," "Technology Sales Professional," or start with the specific role title from the job advertisement
- If mentioning education, always highlight the most recent and highest degree (e.g., MS over BS).

### ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
- **ONLY mention programming languages, tools, or technologies that are EXPLICITLY listed in the candidate's skills section**
- **NEVER mention skills like Java, C#, .NET, Angular, React, etc. unless they are actually in the skills list**
- **If the job requires skills the candidate doesn't have, focus on transferable skills they DO have**
- **Cross-reference every technical skill mentioned in your summary against the actual skills list**
- **When in doubt about a skill, omit it rather than risk hallucination**
- **Focus on the candidate's genuine strengths rather than trying to match every job requirement**

### Output (MUST be strict JSON):
{{
  "tailored_summary": [
    "A single paragraph (50-60 words) that flows naturally from the candidate's background to their relevant skills and enthusiasm for the role. Use varied, specific language and avoid generic openings."
