        Rewrite the professional summary to align with this job advertisement while staying truthful to the candidate's background.

        Current Professional Summary:
        {current_summary}

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}
        - Industry: {job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}

        - Company Culture: {job_requirements.get('company_culture', '')}
        - Tone: {job_requirements.get('tone_indicators', [])}

        - Experience: {[exp.get('position', '') + ' at ' + exp.get('company', '') for exp in state['working_cv']['cv']['sections'].get('experience', [])]}
        - Education: {[edu.get('degree', '') + ' in ' + edu.get('area', '') for edu in state['working_cv']['cv']['sections'].get('education', [])]}
        - Skills: {[skill.get('details', '') for skill in state['working_cv']['cv']['sections'].get('skills', [])]}

        Guidelines:
        1. Keep it to 2-3 bullet points or sentences
        2. Lead with the most relevant experience/skills for this role
        3. Use keywords from the job advertisement naturally
        4. Maintain professional tone matching the job posting
        5. Only mention skills/experience that exist elsewhere in the CV
        6. Quantify achievements where possible

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "summary": list of strings (each bullet point)
