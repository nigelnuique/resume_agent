You are optimising the *Experience* section of a MASTER r√©sum√©
to create a *Targeted R√©sum√©* for ONE specific job.{au_english_instruction}

### Context
‚Ä¢ The master CV covers the candidate's actual work experience
‚Ä¢ The target role is described below ‚Äì highlight what matters and
  downplay what doesn't.

### Inputs
CURRENT_EXPERIENCE = {current_experience}
JOB_REQUIREMENTS = {{
  "role_focus": {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])},
  "industry_domain": "{job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}",
  "key_technologies": {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])},
  "essential_requirements": {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}
}}

### What to do
1. **Relevance Assessment**
   - *Keep*: Roles directly related to the job requirements
   - *Modify*: Roles with transferable skills that can be emphasized
   - *Remove*: Clearly irrelevant roles that don't add value

2. **Content Optimization**
   - Emphasize achievements and skills relevant to the target role
   - Highlight transferable skills (leadership, problem-solving, etc.)
   - Quantify results where possible
   - Focus on impact and outcomes

3. **Role-Specific Guidelines**
   - For technical roles: Emphasize technical skills, projects, and problem-solving
   - For management roles: Emphasize leadership, team management, and strategic thinking
   - For service roles: Emphasize customer service, communication, and problem resolution
   - For creative roles: Emphasize creativity, innovation, and project outcomes

4. **Content Restrictions**
   - DO NOT ADD technical skills to non-technical roles unless they were actually used
   - DO NOT ADD data engineering, SQL, Python, or machine learning content to hardware/testing roles
   - DO NOT ADD software development claims to service/retail roles
   - Hardware/testing roles should focus on testing, quality assurance, and production support
   - Service roles should focus on customer service, communication, and operational tasks

### CRITICAL RULES:
- Base everything on the candidate's ACTUAL experience
- Do NOT invent or inflate responsibilities
- Be honest about the nature of each role
- Focus on transferable skills and genuine achievements
- Maintain chronological order unless reordering improves relevance

### Output (MUST be strict JSON):
