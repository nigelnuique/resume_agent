        Instructions:
        1. Reorder experiences by relevance to the target role (most relevant first)

           - Emphasize skills/achievements relevant to the target role
           - Use keywords from the job advertisement naturally
           - Add quantification where truthful and impactful
           - Remove or de-emphasize irrelevant highlights
        3. Keep all factual information accurate
        4. Maintain chronological accuracy of dates and companies
