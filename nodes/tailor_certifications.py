        Tailor the certifications section by selecting only relevant certifications and ordering them by relevance.

        Current Certifications:
        {current_certifications}

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}

        Instructions:
        1. Select ONLY certifications that are relevant to the target role
        2. Order them by relevance (most relevant first)
        3. Remove certifications that are:
           - Unrelated to the job requirements
           - Too generic or outdated
           - Not adding value to the application
        4. Keep certifications that demonstrate:
           - Skills mentioned in job requirements
           - Industry knowledge relevant to the role
           - Technical competencies needed for the position
