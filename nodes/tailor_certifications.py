        Tailor the certifications section by selecting relevant certifications and ordering them by relevance.

        Current Certifications (USE ONLY THESE - DO NOT CREATE NEW ONES):

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}

        - Technical Expertise: {job_requirements.get('technical_expertise', [])}
        - Professional Qualifications: {job_requirements.get('professional_qualifications', [])}

        Instructions:
        1. Include any certification that relates to any skill, technology, or area of expertise mentioned in the job requirements.
        2. Be inclusive: if there is any reasonable connection between a certification and the job requirements, keep it.
        3. Prioritize certifications that demonstrate proficiency in the job's key technical or professional areas.
        4. Order certifications by relevance to the job requirements (most relevant first).
        5. Remove only certifications that are completely unrelated to the role's requirements.

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Use ONLY the actual certifications listed above.
        - DO NOT create, invent, or generate new certification names.
        - If a certification relates to any skill, technology, or area of expertise in the job requirements, keep it.
        - Only remove certifications that are completely irrelevant to the job requirements.
        - When in doubt, keep the certification.

        PRIORITY ORDER:
        1. Certifications for skills, technologies, or areas of expertise mentioned in the job requirements.
        2. Industry-specific certifications relevant to the role.
        3. Professional certifications that demonstrate relevant expertise.
        4. General certifications that show professional development.

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "relevant_certifications": list of relevant certifications in order of relevance (use EXACT names from the list above)
        - "removed_certifications": list of certification names that were removed
        - "changes_summary": brief explanation of selection criteria and changes made
