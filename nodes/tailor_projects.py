        Select the 4 MOST RELEVANT projects for this job and tailor their content.

        Current Projects ({len(current_projects)} total):

        Job Requirements:

        - Key Technologies: {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])}
        - Essential Requirements: {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}

        Instructions:
        1. Select ONLY the 4 most relevant projects (or fewer if less than 4 exist)
        2. Order them by relevance to the target role (most relevant first)
        3. For each selected project, optimize:
           - Summary to emphasize relevant outcomes and technologies
           - Highlights to showcase skills matching job requirements
           - Use keywords from the job advertisement naturally
           - Add quantification and impact metrics where possible
           - Remove irrelevant details
        4. Keep all factual information accurate
        5. Maintain project timelines and links

        CRITICAL: Return ONLY the top 4 most relevant projects, not all projects.

        Return ONLY a properly formatted JSON object (no additional text) with:
        - "tailored_projects": list of TOP 4 project entries in relevance order with optimized content
        - "changes_summary": brief explanation of selection criteria and content changes
        - "projects_removed": count of how many projects were excluded
        
        Example format:
        {{
            "tailored_projects": [...],
            "changes_summary": "Selected 4 most relevant projects and optimized content",
