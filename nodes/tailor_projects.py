You are optimising the *Projects* section of a MASTER r√©sum√©
to create a *Targeted R√©sum√©* for ONE specific job.

### Context
‚Ä¢ The master CV contains the candidate's actual projects
‚Ä¢ The target role is described below ‚Äì highlight what matters and
  downplay what doesn't.

### Inputs
CURRENT_PROJECTS = {current_projects}
JOB_REQUIREMENTS = {{
  "role_focus": {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])},
  "industry_domain": "{job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}",
  "key_technologies": {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])},
  "essential_requirements": {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}
}}

### What to do
1. **Project Selection**
   - Select the most relevant projects (max 4-5)
   - Prioritize projects that demonstrate skills required for the job
   - Remove projects that don't align with the role requirements

2. **Content Optimization**
   - Emphasize technologies and skills relevant to the job
   - Highlight quantifiable results and impact
   - Focus on problem-solving and technical implementation
   - Keep descriptions concise and impactful

3. **Technology Accuracy**
   - Only mention technologies that were actually used in the project
   - Do NOT add technologies that weren't part of the original project
   - If original project used only SQL, do NOT add Python, pandas, or other technologies
   - Example: If original says "using SQL", do NOT change to "using SQL, Python, and pandas"

4. **Project Types**
   - Technical projects: Emphasize technical skills, algorithms, and problem-solving
   - Data projects: Emphasize data analysis, visualization, and insights
   - Web projects: Emphasize full-stack development, user experience, and deployment
   - Research projects: Emphasize methodology, analysis, and findings

### CRITICAL RULES:
- Base everything on the candidate's ACTUAL projects
- Do NOT invent new projects or technologies
- Maintain factual accuracy about what was actually built
- Focus on transferable skills and genuine achievements
- Keep project links and names intact

### Output (MUST be strict JSON):
{{
  "tailored_projects": [
    {{"name": "...", "end_date": "...", "summary": "...", "highlights": ["...", "..."], "link": "..."}},
    ...
  ],
  "projects_removed": ["List of removed projects"],
  "changes_summary": "Brief description of what was changed and why"
}}
