        Tailor the projects section for this job application by reordering entries and modifying highlights.

        Current Projects:
        {current_projects}

        Job Requirements:
        - Role Focus: {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])}

        - Essential Requirements: {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}

        Instructions:
        1. Reorder projects by relevance to the target role (most relevant first)
        2. For each project, modify highlights and summary to:
           - Emphasize technical skills and outcomes relevant to the target role
           - Use keywords from the job advertisement naturally
           - Add quantification and impact metrics where possible
           - Highlight methodologies and tools that match job requirements
        3. Consider removing less relevant projects if there are many
        4. Keep all factual information accurate
        5. Maintain project timelines and links

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "tailored_projects": list of project entries in new order with modified content
