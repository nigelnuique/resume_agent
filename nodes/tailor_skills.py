You are optimising the *Skills* section of a MASTER r√©sum√©
to create a *Targeted R√©sum√©* for ONE specific job.

### Context
‚Ä¢ The master CV covers multiple fields (data science, electronics,
  IT support, customer success, etc.).
‚Ä¢ The target role is described below ‚Äì highlight what matters and
  downplay / delete what doesn't.

### Inputs
CURRENT_SKILLS  = {valid_skills}
JOB_REQUIREMENTS = {{
  "role_focus": {job_requirements.get('role_focus', [])},
  "industry_domain": "{job_requirements.get('industry_domain', 'General')}",
  "key_technologies": {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])},
  "essential_requirements": {job_requirements.get('essential_requirements', [])}
}}

### What to do
1. **Relevance Test**
   - *Must keep*: skills that map directly to essential requirements
     or obvious ATS keywords in the ad.
   - *Nice to keep*: transferable or supporting skills (keep only the
     top 3-5 that strengthen the application).
   - *Remove/merge*: clearly off-topic or niche stacks that dilute focus.

2. **Re-categorise & Order**
   - Max 5 categories. Within each, max 6 comma-separated items.
   - Put the most critical category first (e.g., "Programming" for a
     software role, "Tools" for a support role).
   - Each skill entry MUST have 'label' and 'details' fields.

3. **ATS Keyword Alignment**
   - Where a skill can be labelled two ways, choose the phrasing used
     in the job ad (e.g., "Windows Admin" over "Microsoft OS" if that
     matches the posting).

4. **Soft Skills (ONLY if relevant)**
   - If the role mentions customer onboarding, training, stakeholder
     communication, etc., add ONE concise soft-skill line.
   - Use specific skills like "Technical communication & end-user training"
   - DO NOT use generic phrases like "Prior experience in..." or list job titles.

5. **Preserve truthfulness**
   - Do **not** invent new technologies; only reorder, rename,
     or merge existing items.
   - Maintain the exact same skill names from the input.
   - Skills should be specific technologies, tools, or methodologies.

### CRITICAL RULES:
- Skills must be specific technologies, tools, or methodologies
- DO NOT use phrases like "Prior experience in..." or "Experience with..."
- DO NOT list job titles or roles (e.g., "IT Support", "technical support")
- DO NOT create generic categories like "IT Support & Customer Success"
- If you can't create a proper soft skills category, don't create one at all

### Output (MUST be strict JSON):
{{
  "tailored_skills": [
    {{"label": "...", "details": "..."}},
    ...
  ],
  "changes_summary": "One- or two-sentence description of what was reordered, merged, or deleted."
}}

### Validation Rules:
- Each skill entry must be a dictionary with 'label' and 'details' fields
- Do not create empty or single-period bullet points
- Maintain factual accuracy - only reorder existing skills
- Skills must be specific technologies, not job descriptions
