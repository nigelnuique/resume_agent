        Tailor the skills section for this job application by reordering and emphasizing relevant skills.

        Current Skills:

        Instructions:
        1. Reorder skill categories and individual skills by relevance to the target role
        2. Move the most relevant skills to the top of each category
        3. Consider creating new categories if it improves relevance
        4. Remove skills that are clearly irrelevant or outdated
        5. Keep all factual information accurate - only reorder, don't add new skills
        6. Ensure essential technologies are prominently featured

        Return a JSON object with:
