        Tailor the skills section for this job application by emphasizing relevant skills and matching terminology.

        Current Skills:

        Job Requirements:
        - Key Technologies: {job_requirements.get('key_technologies', [])}

        Skills mentioned in Experience/Projects (for validation):
        {experience_skills + project_skills}

        Instructions:
        1. Reorder skill categories by relevance to the job
        2. For each skill category:
           - Remove skills not relevant to the target role
           - Use exact terminology from job advertisement where possible
           - Add relevant skills that are mentioned in experience/projects but missing from skills
           - Group related technologies logically
        3. Only add skills that can be supported by experience/projects in the CV
        4. Match naming conventions used in the job posting
        5. Prioritize essential requirements over desirable ones

        Return a JSON object with:
        - "tailored_skills": list of skill category objects with modified details
        - "changes_summary": brief explanation of skills added/removed/reordered
