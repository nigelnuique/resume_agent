        Fix the inconsistencies in this CV by making specific corrections. The cross-reference check found several unsupported claims that need to be addressed.

        Current CV Sections:
        Professional Summary: {working_cv.get('professional_summary', [])}
        Experience: {working_cv.get('experience', [])}

        Inconsistencies Found:

        Instructions:
        1. Remove or modify claims in the professional summary that aren't supported by experience/projects
        2. Remove skills that have no evidence in experience/projects/education
        3. Ensure all claims can be backed up by specific examples in the CV
        4. Keep all factual information accurate - only remove unsupported claims, don't add false information
        5. Maintain the tailored focus for the target job while ensuring accuracy

        Return a JSON object with the corrected sections:
